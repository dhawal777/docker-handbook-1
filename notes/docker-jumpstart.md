## What is Docker?

> Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications using container virtualization technology.

Docker platform consists of multiple products/tools
- docker engine (docker daemon or server)
- `docker-machine`
- `docker-compose`
- docker swarm ?
- [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Why container?

### one application : one physical server

cons

- slow deployment
- more cost
- wasted resources
- difficult to scale and migrate
- tight coupling with hardware vendor

### `virtual machine` (hypervisor based virtualization)

pros

- better resource utilization
- easy to scale
- cloud based
- elastic - get more VM's when needed
- pay as you go

cons

- each VM still requires CPU allocation, storage, RAM, entire guest OS
- more VM's mean more resources
- guest OS implies wasted resources
- portability not guaranteed

### container based virtualization

> container based virtualization uses the kernel on the host's OS to run multiple guest instances

- each guest instance is called `container`
- each container has its own
  - `root` file system
  - `process`
  - `memory`
  - `devices`
  - `network ports`

> It looks and operates like a VM but it is not a VM

> **container interacts with host OS' kernel to create an isolated application platform**
Within each container, application and its dependencies are installed

> container isolates the run time environment

### Container vs VMs

- containers are lightweight
- no guest OS
- less CPU, RAM, storage space
- more containers per m/c than VM
- greater portability

## Benefits of Docker

- separation of concerns
  - developers focus on building the apps
  - sys admins focus on the deployment
- faster development cycle
- application portability
- scalability
- more apps on one host machine

## Docker concepts and terminology

> `docker engine` is program that enables containers to be built, shipped and run.

It is also known as `docker daemon` or `docker server`.
- it uses linux kernel namespaces and control groups to create and manage `containers`.
- it uses `pid`, `net`, `ipc`, `mnt` and `uts` namespaces, to create an isolated workspace called `container`

## Installation

- For Mac/Windows, install docker application from [beta.docker.com](https://beta.docker.com/)
- For Linux, check out instructions at [docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Verify installation by `docker version`.
If you see something like below, you are all set.

## Docker `hello world`

```
$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

```

## Docker client and daemon

- `docker` follows `client/server` architecture
- `client` passes the user inputs to `daemon` or `server`
- `daemon` builds, runs and manages `containers`
- `client` and `server` are most of the time in same host, but can be in different hosts too
- `$ docker version` will provide details of `client` as well as `server`

## Docker containers and images

For the very first execution of `$ docker run hello-world`, `docker` downloaded the `image` `hello-world` for `docker` `registry`
and created a `container` to run the `application` encapsulated in the image.

In case of `hello-world` it excuted [`hello`](https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/blob/master/Dockerfile#L3)

## Docker images

> Images are read only templates, used to create containers

- `$ docker run <image>` will fetch the image from the `docker registry` (most likely hub.docker.com), if not available locally
- `$ docker run image` **will always create a new** `container`
- `images` are specified by `repository:tag`
- if no tag is specified `docker` will use the tag `latest`
- to list the available images, use `docker images`
```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY               TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world              latest              94df4f0ce8a4        6 days ago          967 B
```
- to delete an images, use `docker rmi <image-id>`
  - but if the `image` is being referenced by another `image` or by any `container`, you have to delete them first or use the `-f` option
```
$ docker rmi 94df4f0ce8a4
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete 94df4f0ce8a4 (must be forced) - image is referenced in one or more repositories
...
$ docker rmi 94df4f0ce8a4
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete 94df4f0ce8a4 (must be forced) - image is being used by stopped container ce687d3a026a
```

### Docker Image layers

- `images` are comprised of multiple layers
- a **`layer` is just another image**
- every `image` contains a base layer
- layers are read only

## Docker containers

> Container is an isolated application platform and are based on one or more images and contains everything to run an application, packaged with dependencies

- `$ docker run [options] image [command] [arg...]` will `create` and `run` a `container` from the specified `image`
- to list all the active `container`s, use `docker ps`
- to list all the `container`s, active or inactive, use `docker ps -a`
- to `stop` a container, use `docker stop <container-id>`
- to `start` a container, use `docker start <container-id>`
- to `restart` a container, use `docker restart <container-id>`
- to `delete` a container, use `docker rm <container-id>`
  - an active container can not be deleted
  - a container needs to be stopped before it can be deleted
- to delete all the containers use `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`
- a container runs as long as the process corresponding to the `command`, specified in the `docker run [options] image [command]` runs
  - if no `command` is specified, it runs the default `command`
- command's `pid` is always 1
- `docker` provides a random name to the `container` if not explicitly provided

### Docker containers with terminal access

- use `-i` & `-t` `options` with `docker run`
- `-i` to connect to STDIN on container
- `-t` to get pseudo-terminal

```sh
$ docker run -i -t ubuntu bash
root@0538835f124a:/#
```
`0538835f124a` is the `container id`

### Containers in detached mode

- `$ docker run -d image command`; `-d` tells `docker` to run the container in detached mode, in background
  - make sure the `command` provided runs a hanging process, like run a web server, otherwise the container will stop as soon as the process with `PID 1` exits
- `$ docker logs container-id` to inspect the output of the container
  - `$ docker logs -f container-id` is similat to `tail -f`
- `$ docker run -d -P tomcat` will run tomcat in detached mode
  - `-P` tell `docker` to map `container port` to `host port`
  ```sh
  $ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
  3c4e535cfae8        tomcat              "catalina.sh run"   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:32769->8080/tcp   hungry_pike
  ```
- checkout `IP:PORT` in browser; for example `0.0.0.0:32769` w.r.t. above `docker ps`
- if no command is specified to `docker run` it would execute the `default` command.
  - for tomcat it's `catalina.sh run`

### Terminal access to a container started in detached mode

- `$ docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]` to start the command in the given container
- run a long running process in a docker container in detached mode
```sh
$ docker run -d tomcat
e00264199cf66426aafcf5df48c5ee2b2ddf408bee62d357c2d1d23791f58c26
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
e00264199cf6        tomcat              "catalina.sh run"   6 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        8080/tcp            pensive_engelbart
```
- run `bash` in the already running container
```sh
$ docker exec -i -t e00264199cf6 bash
root@e00264199cf6:/usr/local/tomcat#
```
- exiting from this process will not stop the container as this is not the process with `pid 1`
```sh
root@e00264199cf6:/usr/local/tomcat# ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  1 17:41 ?        00:00:03 /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/usr/local/tomcat/conf/loggin
root        32     0  0 17:43 ?        00:00:00 bash
root        39    32  0 17:44 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
```

### Container writable layer

- when a container is launched from an image, docker adds a writable layer on top.
  - a read/write file system on top of all other layers
- the process that the container will run will be run in this read/write layer
- any changes made will be made to this read/write layer
- all the other layers are readonly
- `docker` uses `copy on write system`
  - a file from read only layer in copied  to a writable layer
  - original read only version is hidden
  - changes happen in writable layer
  - `copy on write system` makes the spinning up container fast
