## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications using container virtualization technology.

Docker platform consists of multiple products/tools
- docker engine (docker daemon or server)
- docker machine
- docker compose
- docker swarm ?
- [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Why container?

### one application : one physical server

cons

- slow deployment
- more cost
- wasted resources
- difficult to scale and migrate
- tight coupling with hardware vendor

### `virtual machine` (hypervisor based virtualization)

pros

- better resource utilization
- easy to scale
- cloud based
- elastic - get more VM's when needed
- pay as you go

cons

- each VM still requires CPU allocation, storage, RAM, entire guest OS
- more VM's mean more resources
- guest OS implies wasted resources
- portability not guaranteed

### container base virtualization

container based virtualization uses the kernel on the host's OS to run multiple guest instances

- each guest instance is called `container`
- each container has its own
  - `root` file system
  - `process`
  - `memory`
  - `devices`
  - `network ports`

It looks and operates like a VM but it is not a VM

**container interacts with host OS' kernel to create an isolated application platform**
Within each container, application and its dependencies are installed

container isolates the run time environment

### Container vs VMs

- containers are lightweight
- no guest OS
- less CPU, RAM, storage space
- more containers per m/c than VM
- greater portability

## Docker concepts and terminology

`docker engine` is program that enables containers to be built, shipped and run.
It is also known as `docker daemon` or `docker server`.
- it uses linux kernel namespaces and control groups to create and manage `containers`.
- it uses `pid`, `net`, `ipc`, `mnt` and `uts` namespaces, to create an isolated workspace called `container`

## Installation

- For Mac/Windows, install docker application from [beta.docker.com](https://beta.docker.com/)
- For Linux, check out instructions at [docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Verify installation by `docker version`.
