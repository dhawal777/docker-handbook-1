## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping and running applications using container virtualization technology.

Docker platform consists of multiple products/tools
- docker engine (docker daemon or server)
- docker machine
- docker compose
- docker swarm ?
- [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Why container?

### one application : one physical server

cons

- slow deployment
- more cost
- wasted resources
- difficult to scale and migrate
- tight coupling with hardware vendor

### `virtual machine` (hypervisor based virtualization)

pros

- better resource utilization
- easy to scale
- cloud based
- elastic - get more VM's when needed
- pay as you go

cons

- each VM still requires CPU allocation, storage, RAM, entire guest OS
- more VM's mean more resources
- guest OS implies wasted resources
- portability not guaranteed

### container base virtualization

container based virtualization uses the kernel on the host's OS to run multiple guest instances

- each guest instance is called `container`
- each container has its own
  - `root` file system
  - `process`
  - `memory`
  - `devices`
  - `network ports`

It looks and operates like a VM but it is not a VM

**container interacts with host OS' kernel to create an isolated application platform**
Within each container, application and its dependencies are installed

container isolates the run time environment

### Container vs VMs

- containers are lightweight
- no guest OS
- less CPU, RAM, storage space
- more containers per m/c than VM
- greater portability

## Docker concepts and terminology

`docker engine` is program that enables containers to be built, shipped and run.
It is also known as `docker daemon` or `docker server`.
- it uses linux kernel namespaces and control groups to create and manage `containers`.
- it uses `pid`, `net`, `ipc`, `mnt` and `uts` namespaces, to create an isolated workspace called `container`

## Installation

- For Mac/Windows, install docker application from [beta.docker.com](https://beta.docker.com/)
- For Linux, check out instructions at [docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Verify installation by `docker version`.
If you see something like below, you are all set.
```

 ```

## Docker `hello world`

```
$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker Hub account:

 https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/
```

## Docker client and daemon

- `docker` follows `client/server` architecture
- `client` passes the user inputs to `daemon` or `server`
- `daemon` builds, runs and manages `containers`
- `client` and `server` are most of the time in same host, but can be in different hosts too
- `$ docker version` will provide details of `client` as well as `server`

## Docker containers and images

images
- read only templates used to create containers

containers
- isolated application platform
- contains everything to run an application, packaged with dependencies
- based on one or more images

## Docker orchestration

- `docker-compose` - create and manage multi-container application
- `docker-swarm` - clusters many engine and schedule containers

## Benefits of Docker

- separation of concerns
  - developers focus on building the apps
  - sys admins focus on the deployement
- faster development cycle
- application portability
- scalability
- more apps on one host machine

## Docker images

- `$ docker images` will list the local `images`
```sh
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              94df4f0ce8a4        3 days ago          967 B
```
- `$ docker run <image>` will fetch the image from the `docker registry` (most likely hub.docker.com) if not available locally
- `images` are specified by `repository:tag`
- if no tag is specified `docker` will use the tag `latest`

## Docker containers

- `$ docker run [options] image [command] [arg...]` will `create` and `run` a `container` from the specified `image`
- `image` is specified with `repository:tag`
- `$ docker run ubuntu ps -ef`
```sh
# will download the image if not available locally ...
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 03:09 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
```

## Docker container with terminal

- use `-i` & `-t` `options` with `docker run`
  - `-i` to connect to STDIN on container
  - `-t` to get pseudo-terminal
  ```sh
  $ docker run -i -t ubuntu bash
  root@0538835f124a:/#
  ```
  - `0538835f124a` is the `container id`

## More on containers ...
- `$ docker run image` **will always create a new** `container`
- use `$ docker start container-id` **to start an existing container**
- to list existing container use `$ docker ps -a`
- use `$ docker ps` to list only the active containers
```sh
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
0538835f124a        ubuntu              "bash"              8 minutes ago       Exited (0) About a minute ago                       mad_mirzakhani
43e171ebaa97        ubuntu              "ps -ef"            14 minutes ago      Exited (0) 14 minutes ago                           elated_wing
913597689e93        hello-world         "/hello"            5 hours ago         Exited (0) 5 hours ago                              suspicious_lovelace
```
- a container runs as long as the process corresponding to the `command`, specified in the `docker run command` runs
- command's `pid` is always 1
- `$ docker run ubuntu ps -ef`
```sh
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 03:09 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
```
- docker provides a random name to the container if not explicitly provided

## Containers in detached mode

- `$ docker run -d image command`; `-d` tells `docker` to run the container in detached mode, in background
  - make sure the `command` provided runs a hanging process, like run a web server, otherwise the container will stop as soon as the process with `PID 1` exits
- `$ docker logs container-id` to inspect the output of the container
  - `$ docker logs -f container-id` is similat to `tail -f`
- `$ docker run -d -P tomcat` will run tomcat in detached mode
  - `-P` tell `docker` to map `container port` to `host port`
  ```sh
  $ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
  3c4e535cfae8        tomcat              "catalina.sh run"   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds        0.0.0.0:32769->8080/tcp   hungry_pike
  ```
- checkout `IP:PORT` in browser; for example `0.0.0.0:32769` w.r.t. above `docker ps`
- if no command is specified to `docker run` it would execute the `default` command.
  - for tomcat its `catalina.sh run`

## Image layers

- `images` are comprised of multiple layers
- a **`layer` is just another image**
- every `image` contains a base layer
- layers are read only

## Container writable layer

- when a container is launched from an image, docker adds a writable layer on top.
  - a read/write file system on top of all other layers
- the process that the container will run will be run in this read/write layer
- any changes made will be made to this read/write layer
- all the other layers are readonly
- `docker` uses `copy on write system`
  - a file from read only layer in copied  to a writable layer
  - original read only version is hidden
  - changes happen in writable layer
  - `copy on write system` makes the spinning up container fast

## `docker commit`

- `docker commit` saves changes in a `container` as a new `image`
- `$ docker commit [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [REPOSITORY[:TAG]]`
  - if no [TAG] is specified, `docker` will use `latest`
  - if no `REPOSITORY` is specified `REPOSITORY` and `TAG` will be `none`
- let's see it in action
  - `$ docker run -it ubuntu bash`
  - in the `ubuntu` container `$ apt-get install -y curl`
    - if you find `E: Unable to locate package curl` error
      - `$ apt-get -qq update`
      - `$ apt-get -qq -y install curl`
      - refer [this StackoOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27273412/cannot-install-packages-inside-docker-ubuntu-image) for further details
  - if the `prompt` seems to be hanging, try pressing `return` or `ctrl + c` and retry
  - `exit` from the container
  - list the container
  ```sh
  $ docker ps -a
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
  9442903e27cc        ubuntu              "bash"              8 minutes ago       Exited (0) 3 seconds ago                       sad_lichterman
  ```
  - `$ docker commit 9442903e27cc curl`
  - list `docker images`
  ```sh
  $ docker images
  REPOSITORY                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
  curl                      latest              2534caf55869        8 seconds ago       173.5 MB
  ubuntu                    latest              44776f55294a        4 days ago          120.1 MB
  ```
  - run the image, with `docker run`
  ```sh
  $ docker run -it curl bash
  root@86d61ffb3dac:/# which curl
  /usr/bin/curl
  root@86d61ffb3dac:/#
  ```

## Dockerfile

### What is Dockerfile?

A `Dockerfile` is a configuration file that contains instructions for building a `Docker image`
- more effective than docker commit
- create image multiple times via `docker build` without carrying out the redundant steps manually
- easily fits in CI/CD process

### Dockerfile instructions

Instructions specify what to do while building `image`
- `FROM` specifies `base image`
  - every `image` needs a `base image`
- `RUN` specifies which command to execute
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get -qq update
RUN apt-get -qq -y install curl
```

## `RUN` instruction

- each `RUN` instruction will execute the command on top of `writable layer` and `commit` the changes
- aggregate multiple `RUN` instructions using `&&` to avoid multiple `commit`
```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get -qq update && apt-get -qq -y install curl
```

## Build image from `Dockerfile`

- `$ docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -`
- `PATH` is the build `context`
- `docker build` will look for `Dockerfile` at the root of the `context`
  - use `-f <file-name>` to specify a custom docker file
- option `-t [repository:tag]` will tag the `image`
```sh
$ docker build -t curl .
Sending build context to Docker daemon 261.6 kB
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> 44776f55294a
Step 2 : RUN apt-get -qq update
 ---> Running in ba9c3738f17b

 ---> fdbb7e8242d7
Removing intermediate container ba9c3738f17b
Step 3 : RUN apt-get -qq -y install curl
 ---> Running in e03c750ff71a

 ---> 33374acd807e
Removing intermediate container e03c750ff71a
Successfully built 33374acd807e
```
- verify the image built via `docker images`
```sh
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
curl                      latest              33374acd807e        2 minutes ago       173.5 MB
```

## `CMD` instruction

- `CMD` defines the default command that will be executed when the container is executed
- `CMD` no role during `image` creation
- **only one** `CMD`, the last one wins
- can be overridden at run time
- `CMD` can be in  three forms
  - `CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]` (exec form, this is the preferred form)
  - `CMD ["param1","param2"]` (as default parameters to ENTRYPOINT)
  - `CMD command param1 param2` (shell form)
- create a new image with `CMD`
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get -qq update
RUN apt-get -qq -y install curl
RUN apt-get -qq -y install iputils-ping

CMD ["ping", "127.0.0.1",  "-c", "30"]
```
- `$ docker build -t ping .` to build a new image
- run the new image via `docker run`
```sh
$ docker run ping
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.039 ms
... 30 times
```
- passing a command via `docker run` will override the default `CMD`
```sh
$ docker run ping echo hello world
hello world
```

## `ENTRYPOINT` instruction

An `ENTRYPOINT` allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.
For example, the following will start nginx with its default content, listening on port 80.

```sh
docker run -i -t --rm -p 80:80 nginx
```

- `ENTRYPOINT` can be in  two forms
  - `ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]` (exec form, preferred)
  - `ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2 (shell form)`
- `ENTRYPOINT` in `exec` form will accept arguments passed via `docker run`
- create an image with `ENTRYPOINT`

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get -qq update
RUN apt-get -qq -y install curl
RUN apt-get -qq -y install iputils-ping

ENTRYPOINT ["ping"]
```

- `$ docker build -t ping .` to build a new image
- run the new image via `docker run` without any arguments

```sh
$ docker run ping
Usage: ping [-aAbBdDfhLnOqrRUvV] [-c count] [-i interval] [-I interface]
            [-m mark] [-M pmtudisc_option] [-l preload] [-p pattern] [-Q tos]
            [-s packetsize] [-S sndbuf] [-t ttl] [-T timestamp_option]
            [-w deadline] [-W timeout] [hop1 ...] destination
```

- run the new image via `docker run` with arguments

```sh
$ docker run ping 127.0.0.1 -c 5
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.043 ms
...
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 3996ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.037/0.040/0.043/0.008 ms
```

## Start and stop a contanier

- `docker start <container-id>` to start a container
- `docker stop <container-id>` to stop a container
- `docker ps` to list all the active containers and their corresponding ids
- `docker ps -a` will list all the containers including exited ones

## Terminal access to a container

- `$ docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]` to start the command in the given container
- run a long running process in a docker container in detached mode
```sh
$ docker run -d tomcat
e00264199cf66426aafcf5df48c5ee2b2ddf408bee62d357c2d1d23791f58c26
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
e00264199cf6        tomcat              "catalina.sh run"   6 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        8080/tcp            pensive_engelbart
```
- run `bash` in the already running container
```sh
$ docker exec -i -t e00264199cf6 bash
root@e00264199cf6:/usr/local/tomcat#
```
- exiting from this process will not stop the container as this is not the process with `pid 1`
```sh
root@e00264199cf6:/usr/local/tomcat# ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  1 17:41 ?        00:00:03 /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=/usr/local/tomcat/conf/loggin
root        32     0  0 17:43 ?        00:00:00 bash
root        39    32  0 17:44 ?        00:00:00 ps -ef
```
